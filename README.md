* Introduction

The deployed Webpage is a simple weather dashboard, that will shaw you the weather for the present day and for the next 5 days for the city that you choose.

URL of the Web page:

https://tristanlibeau.github.io/Weather-Dashboard/

URL of my Repository:

https://github.com/TristanLibeau

* Functionality:

WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
